Q. Define algorithm. List different search algorithms and their time complexity. 
-> is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions, typically to solve a class of problems

Q. In SQL, what are the different types of joins? What is a subquery?  

Q. What's the difference between StringBuilder vs. StringBuffer? 
-> StringBuffer is synchronized, but StringBuilder is not. So StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer.

Q. Explain the Java Collections library. Why is the library so big? How do you know what to use? 
-> JCF(java collection framework) is a set of interfaces and classes that provides methods/ways to store and manipulate the group of objects.

Q. What is the "dom"? 
-> Document Object Model(DOM) is an interface(cross-platform and language-independent) that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure where each node is an object representing a part of document.

Q. Implement exception handling if you had to iterate through an array. 

Q. List two reasons to use threading.
- https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/03/why-we-use-threads-in-java.html
1. to make a task run parallel to another task. e.g. while you upload a big file, you can do other things like navigating other pages.
2. to increase throughput taking full advantage of CPU power
3. to reduce response time
3. to server multiple clients at the same time
[IMPORTANT]
By the way, Threading is not free, it comes with its own challenges. You can only maximize throughput of your application up to certain extent, once numbering of the thread increases up to a certain threshold, they will start competing for CPU and context switching will occur. Context switching means one thread which is using CPU is suspended and CPU is allocated to another thread for execution. When this happens, thread generally loses all of their cached data. If that thread resumes on another core then it has to build its cache from the start.

Threading also introduces a special set of a problem known as multi-threading issue e.g. deadlock, livelock, memory inconsistency error, race conditions, and starvation. It's also very difficult to test a Java program which involves multiple threads. You cannot predict the order of execution in case of multi-threading and without any synchronization. You should also read Java Concurrency in Practice to learn more how to use threads effectively in Java.




Also, parallelism will be limited to the fact of the size of critical section i.e. the part of the code which must be executed by the only thread at a time. If you have a long critical section then eventually all thread will wait there and your program will behave like a single threaded program.
