I have been working as an software engineer for about 18 years.

I've worked for several business domains such as location service, cloud printing, private app store service, home network system, a kind of IoT service, equipment(router, switch, etc.) monitoring system.	// is this good approach to list every thing that I have experienced

For most of times in my career, I used Java, even though now I'm working with C# on .NET Framework and I worked as a back-end software engineer.
I used RDBMS for most of projects that I was involved in, but I'm interested in MongoDB and ElasticSearch, so I gave it a shot(Can I put this in, or is it better to just remove out, or do I need some small projects to apply them to).
And I had chances to work on IaaS such as AWS and Azure for some of projects.

I'm very interested in Big Data, even though I hardly have had chances to work in that kind of fields.
Because when I did cell tower projects, I collected a lot of data from Samsung smart phones out there to calculate cell tower location.
blabla~

And, I'm also interested in IoT service. Actually, I worked for home network service for a long time and long time ago.
In the service, basically, I developed the server that routed packet among devices. For example, it sent control messages from wall pad by users to devices such as gateway or neighbor's wall pad or relay message from the entrance of apartments to wall pad.
and users could control light bulb, gas valve, curtains on windows.
However, we didn't make it, because bla bla~


Currently what I'm doing 

THERE MUST BE CORE about WHAT EXPERTISE I HAVE. chronically, story,

[TVIEW]
- why?
we were providing video surveillance service streaming live and recorded videos. 
so, it was using a lot of storage space to save all of the user videos with reliabilty.
we were storing 1 original and 1 copy videos.
we decided introducing distributed file system, DFS through proof of concept, which could reduce storage consumption to 70%.
we had to change our system structure to make the most use of DFS.
I led the project,

-> good strategy : hold back when I talk to senior, --> so I try to make a presentation or sessions to share ideas
e.g. I suggested that we'd better make some documents because workflows are so complicated and nobody seems to understand entire stories . But, they're not willing to do that. However, I couldn't insist that any more. So, I made some setup using atlassian confluence and demonstrate some features to show how easy and convenient it will be in the end.
