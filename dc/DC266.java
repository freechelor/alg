This problem was asked by Pivotal.

A step word is formed by taking a given word, adding a letter, and anagramming the result. 
For example, starting with the word "APPLE", you can add an "A" and anagram to get "APPEAL".

Given a dictionary of words and an input word, create a function that returns all valid step words.
